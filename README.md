# IncomeBalance
 
This is a demo I made using Swift that lists incomes, expenses and shows a balance.

I used the following:
- UIKit
- CoreData
- MVVM
- UnitOfWOrk pattern
- Storyboard
- Combine
- Delegate
- Date formatting
- Separation of Domain model from CoreData model handling
- unit tests
- Repository pattern
- Auto layout
